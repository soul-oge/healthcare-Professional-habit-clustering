# healthcare-Professional-habit-clustering

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the behaviors of healthcare professionals in response to drug advertisements to identify meaningful patterns and clusters using the KMeans algorithm. The insights derived from this analysis can help pharmaceutical companies optimize their marketing strategies and engagement efforts.

## Objectives
- Explore and preprocess the healthcare professional habit dataset.
- Visualize key trends and patterns related to drug advertisement interactions.
- Apply machine learning techniques, specifically KMeans clustering, to segment healthcare professionals based on their responses to drug advertisements.

## Dataset
The dataset (`data_jamlab_isheero_epitech_0125_2.csv`) contains detailed information on healthcare professional interactions with drug advertisements. Key columns include:
- **Professional ID**: Unique identifier for each healthcare professional.
- **Advertisement Engagement Metrics**: Variables measuring interaction frequency, types of advertisements viewed, and engagement levels.
- **Demographics/Attributes**: Information such as specialization and region.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms (KMeans).

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and handling missing data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations to uncover trends and distributions.
3. **Clustering with KMeans**:
   - Feature selection and scaling.
   - Determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
   - Fitting the KMeans model and assigning cluster labels.
4. **Result Interpretation**: Analysis of cluster characteristics.

## Key Results
- Segmentation of healthcare professionals into distinct behavioral clusters based on their response to drug advertisements.
- Identification of dominant patterns in advertisement engagement.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into healthcare professional engagement with drug advertisements using clustering techniques. The findings can be leveraged by pharmaceutical companies to enhance marketing strategies and improve engagement outcomes.

## Future Work
- Test with additional clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN).
- Integrate more demographic and behavioral data for deeper insights.
- Deploy as a web application for real-time data exploration.
